### ThinBASIC

ThinBASIC is a BASIC Interpreter full of thousands of features and ... fast, very fast!

...and you may wonder - why is it "thin" then? The reason is simple - the language core is really small, surrounded by number of focused modules.


### About

ThinBASIC has been developed by Eros Olmi and Petr Schreiber since 2004.
On GitHub we will release sources of some part of ThinBASIC like some ThinBASIC modules and libraries.

### Documentation

### Compiling from Sources

Compilation of ThinBASIC sources needs PowerBASIC Compiler and ThinBASIC development Kit included in ThinBASIC distribution.
At least ThinBasic version 1.9.14.0 is needed.
